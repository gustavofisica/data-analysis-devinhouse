# Input Data

This directory contains original source data files used by notebooks and scripts. Organized by file type.

## Subdirectories

- **csv/**: CSV source files
- **txt/**: Text source files  
- **xlsx/**: Excel workbook source files
- **images/**: Image files for reference or input

## Usage

Do not modify input files directly—treat them as original source data. Scripts and notebooks read from these files to generate processed outputs. See the specific subdirectory READMEs for detailed file inventory and sources.
