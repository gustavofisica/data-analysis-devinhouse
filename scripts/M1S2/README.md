# Module 1 - Week 2

This directory contains scripts developed for the exercises of Module 1, Week 2 of the DEVinHouse 2025 course.



## Exercises

- **temperature_converter.py**: Program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user chooses the input and output units. Uses `float()` for precision.
- **type_checker.py**: Program that receives user input and identifies if it is an integer, a decimal number, or a string. Uses `type()` and try/except for casting and verification.
- **guessing_game.py**: Game where the computer chooses a number between 1 and 100 and the user tries to guess it. Provides hints ("higher", "lower") until the user gets it right. Uses `random.randint()`, `while`, and `input()`.

## How to run
Run the scripts using Python 3. Example:

```bash
python temperature_converter.py
```
